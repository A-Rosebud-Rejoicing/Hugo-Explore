      <description>There was this woman who thought she found somebody.
She could have sworn it was a beginning of something incredible.
It was all that she could muster to pull herself together to admit that she was hopeful.
Never proud.
Never inconsiderate.
Never empty.
She built herself up without somebody.
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a game of chess with the unwitting.</description>

      <description>A Rosebud Rejoicing is a publishing company specializing in art.
On February 1, 2013; Kalika Kay Curry determined that she wanted her own company. The name A Rosebud Rejoicing came from the etymology.
The true birth of the company began as a seed. After being laid off in October of 2014, with ninth months of severance, the young entrepreneur decided that it was an appropriate time as any to register the business.</description>
