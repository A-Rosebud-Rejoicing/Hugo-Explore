This is a page in dirb.

We're considering implementing a goodreads shortcode!
What's needed for the button? Formatting will be done on md file and through templating, naturally. Perhaps I'll have a books page or something. Hell if I know. 
The thought has occured to me to put up an individual page or link for each book. There are four of them.

They're all in the Life Imitates Art Family, but only two of them are a part of the series - I'm in the middle of writing the next one and then I'm going 
to go back and fix the others.

I don't want to list the reviews, I just want a button that'll take you to write some or that will take you straight to the book, right? 

When I think about linking and the images I'm sending, I really want to send people to the good reads posts because I might have the same distributor always and 
Goodreads links to other vendors/sellers. Also they have the opportunity to send you the library. It seems smarter to link you to the GoodReads article, though
I'd prefer you go online and just buy the damn books!
