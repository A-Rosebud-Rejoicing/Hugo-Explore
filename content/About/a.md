A Rosebud Rejoicing is a publishing company specializing in art.

On February 1, 2013; _Kalika Kay_ Curry determined that she wanted her own company. 
The name A Rosebud Rejoicing came from the [etymology](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-name-kalika-curry/).

The true birth of the company began as a seed. After being laid off in October of 2014, with ninth months of severance, 
the young entrepreneur decided that it was an appropriate time as any to register the business. 

In November of 2015, with the incentive to write a books series, the business evolved into a publishing company.
Designed to publish and promote art in any medium; the company continues its journey with its founder.
