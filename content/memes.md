This is a note about a meme I made.
{{< facebook "https://www.facebook.com/notes/a-rosebud-rejoicing/balls-out/1688877737831976/" >}}

I don't lik the way the notes appear in an iFrame, so framing them as I do with the other sites, might be a bad idea.

I keep thinking that I want to make them into a gallery of sorts. Have the photos swoop by you and allow you to
select the link that'll take you to my Facebook page where the memes are explained.

Some memes fall under the same category, I think.
Do I want to share the progression of the meme, when there's more than one version them?

No. No i don't want to show all versions of the meme, I'll leave that to Google and their image search utilities because they change over time.

So I want to keep the origins on Facebook. I might... MIGHT want to copy a few of the explanations over onto my personal blog so that I have control 
over the content, but - I think I'm going to risk the loss. We lose origins over time it's a thing to be expected.

A concept understood and respected.

So what now? Well, I want the link, title, and header image of the meme, I think. Can I grab that straight off of facebook notes? Link, Title, Image, only?

They have an embed feature. The embed feature appears to have the ability. I'm going to investigate if there's an api that'll return 
the markup for the notes on a facebook page and if I can, I will. If not - I'll have to come up with something else. 

What? I don't know. But - something to remember or think about is that these notes are available right off the bat on my Facebook page.
Why wouldn't I just direct people there? 

And this is where creativity comes in. I do want a gallery. The gallery will feature the note, a few different versions of the meme, and a link to the books
that these memes represent. 

Maybe it'll also include the ... other this is getting over complicated. I'm going to have to draw this one up, I thnk.
