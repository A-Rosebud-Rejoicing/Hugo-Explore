There was this woman who thought she found somebody.

She could have sworn it was a beginning of something incredible.

It was all that she could muster to pull herself together to admit that she was hopeful.

Never proud. 

Never inconsiderate.

Never empty.

She built herself up without somebody. 

There's nothing like a game of chess with the unwitting.
